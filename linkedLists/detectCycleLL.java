/* Linked Lists: Detect a Cycle */

/**
 * Problem Statement
 * 
 * A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list.
 * For example, in the following graph there is a cycle formed when node 5 points back to node 3.
 * 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 3
 */

/**
 * Function Description
 * 
 * Complete the function has_cycle in the editor below. It must return a boolean true if the graph contains a cycle, or false.
 * has_cycle has the following parameter(s):
 * head: a pointer to a Node object that points to the head of a linked list.
 * Note: If the list is empty, head will be null.
